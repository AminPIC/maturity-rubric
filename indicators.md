# Indicators

The second phase in the development of the maturity rubric is to identify key 
indicators for each category. Each category may have between 8-12 indicators

A page will be created for each category to facilitate conversation around the
indicators that will be used to measure a product against this category. Many of
these indicators may be mapped to existing maturity models such as CHAOSS, Clearly Defined,
Digital Square, and the DIAL OSC. 

For each indicator, we will define core data:

  * Description
  * Qualitative/Quantitative
  * Data Source 
  * Measurement Process

In the case of Qualitative data, the measurement process will involve a community of 
reviewers who will establish a score for products for that indicator. A data store
will be set up to track the score.
