# Scoring

Different organizations will have different priorities, so we do not expect to have a single
maturity scoring system that will apply to all actors in the T4D space. However, we will
have a common language and definitions that will allow organizations to use the same data
as a baseline for their evaluations and scoring.

As a part of this work, we will develop a reference scoring. This scoring system will
take all of the categories and indicators and prioritize them, giving a weighting factor
to each. 

A single product maturity score will be determined by multiplying the score for each indicator
multiplied by the weight. A user can also view the score for each category, and within a 
category can see the score of each indicator.
