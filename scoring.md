# Scoring

Different organizations will have different priorities, so we do not expect to have a single
maturity scoring system that will apply to all actors in the T4D space. However, we will
have a common language and definitions that will allow organizations to use the same data
as a baseline for their evaluations and scoring.



As a part of this work, we will also develop a reference scoring.
