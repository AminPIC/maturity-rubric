# User stories and User journeys

The goal of this work is to identify the different types of users and how they will
interact with the maturity rubric. We want to clearly define the needs of different
user categories and ensure that the data and presentation of the rubric are aligned
to provide the necessary information in a clear manner for each type of user.

## User Categories

The following are proposed categories for users. Each category may be further 
broken down into sub-categories. 

* [Technical](#technical-users)
* [Procurement](#procurement-users)


## Technical Users

Technical users may be broken down further into:

* Product developers
* Implementers
* Volunteer contributors (and organizations such as [Ovio](https://ovio.org) who are mapping
volunteers to specific projects)

## Procurement Users

Procurement users will be able to use the rubric to evaluate similar products.
