# Categories/Lenses

The following are candidates for high-level categories or lenses for product evaluation.
The initial list is based on work done by Digital Impact Alliance. More details can be 
found in the https://gitlab.com/dial/digital-global-goods/maturity-rubric repository.

* Utility and Impact
* Compliance
* Licensing
* Financial Sustainability
* Community Health
* Governance
* Product Design
* Knowledge Management
* Product Quality
* Dependency and Risk

Based on the comments and feedback, we will create a loosely-prioritized list of 
8-10 categories that are important for product evaluation

For each category, we create a definition and identify indicators and methods for 
collecting data to establish a 'score' for a product.
