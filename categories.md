# Categories/Lenses

The following are candidates for high-level categories or lenses for product evaluation,
along with a brief description for each category:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Utility and Impact](categories/utility.md) | Product utility and impact (with alignment to SDG agendas) |
| [Compliance](categories/compliance.md) | Software standard and other domain-specific compliances |
| [Licensing](categories/licensing.md) | Licensing and IP accessibility |
| [Financial Sustainability](categories/sustainability.md) | Revenue generation and cost management |
| [Community Health](categories/community.md) | Engagement, management and vitality of contributor community |
| [Governance](categories/governance.md) | Governance, leadership and decision-making |
| [Product Design](catgegories/design.md) | Product design planning, feature release lifecycle code change / issue management |
| [Knowledge Management](categories/knowledge.md) | Documentation robustness and knowledge distribution for usage and code contribution |
| [Product Quality](categories/quality.md) | General quality of a product |
| [Dependency and Risk](categories/risk.md) | Risk and dependency on community composition and organizational affiliations |


## Workflow

In this phase of work, users can suggest changes to the short description, the priority
of this category and whether it is a core/required category. Please submit these changes
in a pull request.

Users can also raise an issue to suggest a new category or the removal of one of the existing
categories.

Based on the comments and feedback, we will create a loosely-prioritized list of 
8-10 categories that are important for product evaluation

After the categories have been agreed upon and have clear definitions, work will proceed to the
next phase of [identifying indicators](indicators.md) and methods for collecting data to establish a 'score' for a product in each category.
