# Maturity Rubric

This repository is a shared space for conversation and collaboration to define core
standards and specifications for a rubric that can be use to evaluate and vet digital
public goods. 


## Introduction

Many digital platforms have been developed to support Sustainable Development Goals. 
However, no metric or system has been defined to evaluate the maturity, quality, and
sustainability of these goods. 

This project is a cooperative effort led by [Digital Impact Alliance](https://digitalimpactalliance.org)
and [Unicef Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/) to establish
a core set of categories and criteria that can be used to evaluate and 'score' digital 
technologies. This data will provide much needed information to help actors understand and 
select digital tools to support their projects and use cases.

## Goal

The goal of this work is to define a common taxonomy for evaluating digital products.
This taxonomy will include broad categories for evaluating products and specific indicators
or data points that can be collected.


## Proposed workflow

The initial work on the maturity rubric is to define and agree on a set of categories that 
will be used for evaluating digital goods. See the [Categories](categories.md) page for 
information on that work.

The second phase of the work will be to define specific indicators for each category. 
Indicators are data points that can be collected for each product that we wish to evaluate. 
These indicators may be either quantitative or qualitative. See the [Indicators](indicators.md) 
page for more information
